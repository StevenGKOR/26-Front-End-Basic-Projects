This is not a typical project as usual, but a set of small projects on Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS

Depending on the project you will see, it can have simple DOM commands up to ES6 syntax, asynchronous, OPP and API fetching

All the projects are made with vanilla Javascript without any other library or framework, also the same applies to the css, except for one where I have used the momentjs library for the date format
